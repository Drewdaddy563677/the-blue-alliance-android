The Blue Alliance is a tool to help FIRST Robotics teams scout for, compete at, and relive competitions. Founded in the fall of 2006, The Blue Alliance began as a website dedicated to providing everyone involved in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) with scouting data and match videos. Since then, the project has grown to include developers from within the FIRST community from various teams all over the world. We continually strive to make The Blue Alliance an even more valuable resource for our users and to help improve the FRC experience.


We have created an app that allows you to access all the great content on http://www.thebluealliance.com on your Android device. You can keep up to date with live events, see what teams are competing when, or look back at the vast archive of historical match data and videos. The Blue Alliance Android app is the perfect companion for anybody looking to have the most up to date information about FRC competitions.
